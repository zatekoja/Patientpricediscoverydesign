# Documentation Archive

This folder contains historical documents moved out of the active documentation surface.

- `root/`: historical top-level project notes and implementation summaries.
- `backend/`: backend phase/status/checklist/history documents.
- `github/`: historical CI/workflow implementation notes.

These files are preserved for context and auditability, but they are not the primary source of truth for current development.
